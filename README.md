# Datasets Preparation

Download all the UEA Multivariate time series archive datasets from [here] (http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/) 

The data structure should look like this:

```none
SupCon-TSC
├── ...
├── data
│   ├── BasicMotion
│   ├── Cricket
```

# Overview

This work has proposed supervised contrastive learning for time series classifcation
(SupCon-TSC). This model is based on the instance-level and cluster-level supervised
contrastive learning approaches to learn the discriminative and universal representation for the multivariate time series dataset

# Train
To train the model, please run the command below:

python main.py --lr1 0.001 --lr2 0.001 --batch_size_emb 10 --batch_size_cl 5 --Epoch 100 --name_dataset BasicMotions
